# VIS
Given a file representing the weighing table - table.txt (attached to the letter). Each line is a separate entry. Columns (time, car number, mass) are separated by commas. You must write a program that reads table.txt and overwrites its data into files of the same format (one file for each machine number). Those. all weighings are 'truck 1' in one, 'truck 2' in another, etc. The program should be written taking into account the possibility of the appearance of new entries in it (respectively, new trucks, another time i.e. - universal as part of the assignment). Information in files should be sorted by time. At the end of the file add a line containing the total mass.
